#Ruby <3's OOP

##Learning Objectives
By the end of lesson, students will be able to...

* Distinguish between hashes & classes in Ruby
* Initialize instances of a class
* Define getter and setter methods
* Compare and contrast instance and class variables
* Use inheritance to extend the behavior of a class

##Hashes

Let's create a new Hash

* Hashes are simple key value stores.

>How can I organize my data using key/value pairs in Ruby? Like so:

```ruby
{name: "Napoleon", fav_food: "steak", skills: ["archery", "combat", "egg farming"]}
```

##Objects

* Everything in Ruby is an Object; however, we almost never use plain vanilla Objects because there are more sophisticated implementations of them such a `String`, `Integer`, and `Hash`.

>How can we prove that the Hash we just created inherited from `Basic Object`?

##Classes

### Define and Instantiate a Class

Class definitions require three basic components: the reserved word `class`, a name of the class, and the reserved word `end`. By convention, the class name begins with a capital letter.

```ruby
class Car
end
```

To create instances of our class, we will create a variable and assign it the return value of the `Car` class's `Car.new` method.

```ruby
fiat = Car.new
fiat.class
#=> Car
```

### Instance methods

We are able to create instances of a `Car`, but our class is *very* simple and our instances currently don't give us much. We'd like to add properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) for our car instances. We'll start by looking at **instance methods** and **instance variables**. An instance method represents a function that is accessible on every instance of a class. To create an instance method, we just create a regular method inside our class definition. Here's the syntax:

```ruby
class Car
  def drive
    "You're going places!"
  end
end
```

Now every car we create will have a "drive" behavior.

```ruby
fiat.drive
```

###Challenge: Race (5m)

**Enable this code:**

```ruby
car.race
#=> "And I'm off!"
```

>Classes are analogous to constructors in JavaScript.

##Attributes & Instance Variables

What should we do if we want to set attributes on the car, such as a paint color and year?

Let's give each instance of `Car` a color using instance variables.

An instance variable, which begins with the `@` symbol, has the capability of storing data for each instance of a class.

To do this, we'll create getter and setter methods, first by hand and then with a shortcut. We do this instead of accessing instance variables directly. We can then access the getters and setters with dot notation.  Let's look at an example.

```ruby
class Car
  def color=(color)
    @color = color
  end

  def color
    @color
  end
end

vw = Car.new
vw.color = "black"
vw.color
#=> "black"

bmw = Car.new
bmw.color = "yellow"
bmw.color
#=> "yellow"
```

>Note: `color=` is a method. Additionally ruby doesn't require parenthesis for arguments passed into a method. As a result, calling this method looks very much like an assignment (which is the point).

###Challenge: Engine Size (5m)

**Enable this code:**

```ruby
fiat = Car.new
fiat.cc = "500"
fiat.cc
#=> "500"
```

Every time an instance of `Car` is assigned a color, it will have its *own* instance variable named `@color`.

##Initialization

>Goal: let's create a Car that goes "Vroom" when it's first *initialized*

In Ruby there's a built-in method named `initialize` that is invoked every time a class is instantiated. Let's prove that this is true by adding a method named `initialize`.

```ruby
class Car
  def initialize
    "Vroom"
  end

  def color=(color)
    @color = color
  end

  def color
    @color
  end
end

bmw = Car.new
audi = Car.new
```

>Goal: let's give the car a color when it's created.  

```ruby
class Car
  def initialize(color)
    @color = color
  end

  def color=(color)  
    @color = color
  end

  def color
    @color
  end
end

bmw = Car.new("black")
bmw.color
```

Since we don't *have* to put parentheses around method parameters when we call them, we can change a car's color with familiar syntax:

```ruby
bmw.color=("red")
bmw.color="red with FLAME decals"
# both work to change the car's color
```


## `attr_*`

If we add more methods to our class, we will start to notice a lot of repetition:

```ruby
class Car
  def initialize(color, make)
    @color = color
    @make = make
  end

  def make=(make)
    @make = make
  end

  def make
    @make
  end

  def color=(color)
    @color = color
  end

  def color
    @color
  end
end
```

Every getter has a method with a name (`make` and `color`) that is included in the instance variable (`@make` and `@color`). The same is true for setters.  

Ruby provides a syntax to shorten this common pattern: attributes. Attributes allow for the introduction of a different syntax for creating getters and setters. Let's demonstrate this by using Ruby's attributes to create a getter for `make`.


``` ruby
class Car
  attr_reader :make  # getter

  def initialize(color, make)
    @color = color
    @make = make
  end

  def make=(make)
    @make = make
  end

  def color=(color)
    @color = color
  end

  def color
    @color
  end
end

bmw = Car.new("black", "bmw")
bmw.make
```

`attr_reader` does the same thing as our former method `make`. We can also use this shorthand syntax to create setters with attributes:

``` ruby
class Car
  attr_reader :make  # getter
  attr_writer :make  # setter

  def initialize(color, make)
    @color = color
    @make = make
  end

  def color=(color)
    @color = color
  end

  def color
    @color
  end
end
```

Finally, if we want both a getter (reader) and setter (writer), we can use attr_accessor:

```ruby
class Car
  attr_accessor :make, :color  # getters and setters!

  def initialize(color, make)
    @color = color
    @make = make
  end
end
```

###Challenge: Animals (10m)

**Enable this code:**

```ruby
# Create a new animal
zazu = Animal.new("hornbill")
zazu.type
#=> "hornbill"
# Animal is awake by default
zazu.state
#=> "awake"
# Make the animal sleep
zazu.sleep
#=> "asleep"
# Make the animal wake up
zazu.wake
#=> "awake"
# Feed the animal
zazu.eat("bugs")
#=> "Yum! I, as a hornbill love to eat bugs!"
```

<details><summary>Example solution</summary>

```ruby
class Animal
  attr_accessor :state, :type
  def initialize(kind)
    @type = kind
    @state = "awake"
  end

  def sleep
    @state = "asleep"
  end

  def wake
    @state = "awake"
  end
  
  def eat (food)
    "Yum! I, as a #{@type} love to eat #{food}!"
  end
end
```

</details>


##Class variables, class methods, and `self`

Now, there may be moments where we want to get or set properties and behaviors that relate to all instances of a class, as a group. In this case, we need to explore class methods and class variables.

Class methods and class variables are used when data pertains to more than just an instance of a class. Let's imagine that we want to keep count of all cars that were instantiated. We use a class variable, indicated by `@@`.


```ruby
class Car
  attr_accessor :make, :color
  @@count = 0

  def initialize(color, make)
    @color = color
    @make = make
  end
end
```

Adding the class variable was easy enough.  Next, we'll define a getter for it using the keyword `self`. We will explore `self` more during the next several days. For now, know that if you place the word `self` next to a method name, it places the method on the class instead of on an instance of the class.

```ruby
class Car
  attr_accessor :make, :color
  @@count = 0

  def initialize(color, make)
    @color = color
    @make = make
  end

  def self.count
    @@count
  end
end

Car.count
# #=> 0
```

Our car count isn't actually counting anything yet!  We'll update the count in the `initialize` method so that it increases each time a car is created.

```ruby
class Car
  attr_accessor :make, :color
  @@count = 0

  def initialize(color, make)
    @color = color
    @make = make
    @@count += 1
  end

  def self.count
    @@count
  end
end

Car.count
# #=> 0

bmw = Car.new('bmw', 'white')
Car.count
# #=> 1

audi = Car.new('audi', 'silver')
Car.count
# #=> 2
```

##Inheritance

Inheritance lets us reuse code from one class as we create subtypes of that class.


### Base Class

We'll use our `Car` class as a *baseclass* and make a new `Pickup` class that inherits from `Car`.  Another way to say this is that `Pickup` will be a *subclass* of `Car`.  You can also think of `Car` as `Pickup`'s *parent* and `Pickup` as `Car`'s *child* (as in a class inheritance tree).

Notice that this `Car` class is spruced up with a new `@speed` instance variable and an `accelerate` instance method.

```ruby
class Car
  attr_accessor :make, :color, :speed
  @@count = 0

  def initialize(color, make)
    @speed = 0
    @color = color
    @make = make
    @@count += 1
  end

  def self.count
    @@count
  end

  def accelerate(change)
    @speed += change
  end
end
```


### Subclass

The syntax for inheritance uses `<` in the class definition.  Our pickup trucks will have another property that cars don't: the capacity of their truck beds (`@bed_capacity`). They'll also have a behavior that allows for riding in the back (`ride_in_back`).

```ruby
class Pickup < Car

  def initialize(color, make, bed_capacity)
    @speed = 0
    @color = color
    @make = make
    @bed_capacity = bed_capacity
    @@count += 1
  end

  def ride_in_back
    "Bumpy but breezy!"
  end
end
```

Even though we didn't define the `accelerate` method again, a pickup truck will inherit the behavior from the `Car` class.

```ruby
truck_one = Pickup.new("red", "Ford", 100)
truck_one.speed
#=> 0
truck_one.accelerate(40)
truck_one.speed
#=> 40
```

Inheritance doesn't go the other way, new cars don't know how to use the `ride_in_back` behavior.

```ruby
focus = Car.new("green", "Ford")
##=> #<Car:0x007f8c4c1b3520 @speed=0, @color="green", @make="Ford">
focus.ride_in_back
##=> NoMethodError: undefined method `ride_in_back' for #<Car:0x007f8c4c1b3520 
##=> @speed=0, @color="green", @make="Ford">
```

*Note:* All subclasses share the same class variable, so changing a class variable within a subclass changes the class variable for the base class and all other subclasses. This can be good when, for instance, we want to update the total `Car` count whenever a new `Pickup` is created. However, `Pickup`'s `@@count` will always be equal to the total `Car` count.

## Super

We can refactor the `Pickup` class with the super keyword, that is a placeholder for anything the car has previously defined. The example below is equivalent to above.

```ruby
class Pickup < Car

  def initialize(color, make, bed_capacity)
    super(color, make)
    @bed_capacity = bed_capacity
    @@count += 1
  end

  def ride_in_back
    "Bumpy but breezy!"
  end
end
```

###Challenge: People (15m)

**Enable this code**

```ruby
# Create people
justin = Person.new(33, "male", "Justin")
jimmy = Person.new(27, "male", "Jimmy")
# Inherit from animals
justin.state
#=> "awake"
# Greet the world
justin.greet
#=> "Hi, I'm Justing. I'm a male, and 33 years old."
# Eat food
justin.eat('carrots')
#=> "Yum! I am eating carrots!"
# But not other people
jimmy.eat('person')
#=> "Sir! I am NOT a cannibal!"
# Keep track of the people count
Person.total
#=> 2
```

<details><summary>Example solution</summary>

```ruby
class Person < Animal
  @@count = 0
  attr_accessor :age, :gender, :name
  def initialize(age, gender, name)
    super("person")
    @age = age
    @gender = gender
    @name = name
    @@count += 1
  end

  def self.total
    @@count
  end

  def eat(food)
    food == "person" ? 
      "Sir! I am NOT a cannibal!" :
      "Yum! I am eating #{food}!"
  end

  def greet
    "Hi, I'm #{@name}. I'm a #{@type}, and #{@age} years old."
  end
end
```
